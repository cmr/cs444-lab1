My submission for the [shell
assignment](http://web2.clarkson.edu/class/cs444/assignments/shell/).

It is written in [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/). Every required feature
works. It also supports setting environment variables via `a=b` before the
command. `history 4` will print the last 4 commands.
